/*
Define a class that holds information about a mobile phone device: model, manufacturer, price, owner, battery characteristics 
(model, hours idle and hours talk) and display characteristics (size and number of colors). Define 3 separate classes 
(class GSM holding instances of the classes Battery and Display).
Define several constructors for the defined classes that take different sets of arguments (the full information for the class or 
part of it). Assume that model and manufacturer are mandatory (the others are optional). All unknown data fill with null.
